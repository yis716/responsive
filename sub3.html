								<dt>The world's historic sites face climate change. Can Petra lead the way?</dt>
								<dd>
									As drought has made local agriculture precarious, climate change has also made flash flooding more frequent, threatening
									both the area's ancient ruins and local communities. And more intense temperature swings have accelerated the weathering
									of historic sandstone facades that were carved at the height of the Roman Empire.
								</dd>
								<dd>
									Since the 1980s, the nearby archaeological site of Petra has turned into a global tourism hotspot. Nearly a million
									visitors visit Petra each year to marvel at the tombs and temples cut into sandstone by the Nabatean civilization almost
									2,000 years ago. They, too, are threatened by flash floods, and damage to the archaeological site would endanger the
									tourism business locals have come to rely on.
								</dd>
								<dd>
									Lessons from the past are also being used to help adapt to extreme conditions in the future. “There is ancient wisdom
									physically built into the site,” Herrmann says. “Combined with modern solutions, that Nabatean water management system
									has the greatest potential for adapting Petra to flash floods.”

								<dd>
									The campaign to protect the Vjosa, which enjoyed overwhelming public support, involved years of protests, lawsuits, and
									international pressure on Albania to scrap the dam plans. The government, which has struggled to improve economic
									conditions in one of Europe's poorest countries, long resisted, especially since Albania relies almost exclusively on
									hydropower for electricity.
								</dd>
								<dd>
									The problem of how to best protect rivers has long vexed conservationists. Historically, rivers have been treated as
									part of land protections. But studies show that rivers do not benefit from this approach, in part because they may flow
									in and out of protected areas and sometimes cross borders. What happens at the unprotected end of a river can have a
									profound impact on the same body hundreds of miles away.
